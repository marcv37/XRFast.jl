**Abstract:** *X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy is a common technique in the field of heritage science. However, data processing and data interpretation remain a challenge as they are time consuming and often require a priori knowledge of the composition of the materials present in the analyzed objects. For this reason, we developed an open-source, unsupervised dictionary learning algorithm reducing the complexity of large datasets containing 10s of thousands of spectra and identifying patterns. The algorithm runs in Julia, a programming language that allows for faster data processing compared to Python and R. This approach quickly reduces the number of variables and creates correlated elemental maps, characteristic for pigments containing various elements or for pigment mixtures. This alternative approach creates an overcomplete dictionary which is learned from the input data itself, therefore reducing the a priori user knowledge. The feasibility of this method was first confirmed by applying it to a mock-up board containing various known pigment mixtures. The algorithm was then applied to a macro XRF (MA-XRF) data set obtained on an 18th century Mexican painting, and positively identified smalt (pigment characterized by the co-occurrence of cobalt, arsenic, bismuth, nickel, and potassium), mixtures of vermilion and lead white, and two complex conservation materials/interventions. Moreover, the algorithm identified correlated elements that were not identified using the traditional elemental maps approach without image processing. This approach proved very useful as it yielded the same conclusions as the traditional elemental maps approach followed by elemental maps comparison but with a much faster data processing time. Furthermore, no image processing or user manipulation was required to understand elemental correlation. This open-source, open-access, and thus freely available code running in a platform allowing faster processing and larger data sets represents a useful resource to understand better the pigments and mixtures used in historical paintings and their possible various conservation campaigns.*

The aim of this repository is to give full access to a Julia package called XRFast designed for dictionary learning and sparse representation of XRF signals using KSVD. Also included is a Jupyter notebook showing how to use this package, a test dataset, and instructions allowing for the identification of spectral endmembers and their spatial distribution across a 2D work of art.

The intention is that the presented research can be fully replicated and implemented by other scientists in their host institutions. 

Efforts have been made to the best of the authors' abilities to make the data processing procedures accessible and reusable in support of the growing Open Science movement. <br>

## 1. Overview of contents
#### 1.1. Jupyter notebook (XRF Dictionary learning)
Most of the data treatment is undertaken in the Jupyter notebook. To successfully produce the final text figures, cells within the notebook should be run sequentially. Further pertinent instructions are provided throughout the notebook.

Required versions: [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)>=5.5, [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/)>=1.5 

#### 1.2. Install requirements
All packages required to run the notebook can be installed within the Jupyter notebook or using the Julia command prompt. <br>
To install a package, use the following lines: <br>
> using Pkg <br>
> Pkg.add("Package Name") <br>

To install the <b>XRFast package</b>, use the following import line: 
>Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/NU-ACCESS/XRFast.jl") <br>

#### 1.3. Test dataset
The XRF data cube from a selected area of an untitled 18th century Mexican painting belonging to the permanent collection of the National Museum of Mexican Art (Chicago, IL, USA) used in the article is [provided](https://.../) as a test dataset. <br>

## 2. Notebook
Markdown cells provide the instructions and expected output of the subsequent cells of code. 

## 3. Endmember distribution maps and spectra
Endmember distribution maps and spectra are exported as a .csv files using comma as delimiter. <br>

<li><b>Endmember spectra</b> can be imported in Excel or other graphing applications for further data processing. <br>
<li>A stack of <b>endmember distribution maps</b> can be created in ImageJ (Fiji) by following the steps below (also found in the Jupyter Notebook): </ol><br>

<ol>
<li><b>Import data</b>: File>>Import>>text Image...<br>
<i>Select the desired .csv file</i></li>
<li><b>Create a stack</b>: Image>>Stacks>>Tools>>Montage to Stack...<br>
<ins>Columns</ins>: last number of the filename, before the .csv <br>
<ins>Rows</ins>: 1 <br>
<ins>Border width</ins>: 0</li>
<li><b>Transform compressed stack into stack of images</b>: Image>>Stacks>>Reslice[/]... (or Shortcut Stk>>Reslice[/]...) on the <i>Stack</i> window created</li>
<ins>Output spacing (pixels)</ins>: 1.000 <br>
<ins>Start at</ins>: Top <br>
<ins>Avoid interoplation</ins> should be checked <br>
<i>Flip vertically</i> and <i>Rotate 90 degrees</i> can be checked or unchecked depending on the orientation of the original data. 
<li><b>Save as a set of individual images</b>: File>>Save As>>Image Sequence... <br>
<ins>Dir.</ins>: Select the folder where images will be saved <br>
<ins>Format</ins>: select the desired format (TIFF is the default option) <br>
<ins>Name</ins>: Indicate the root name of the images + EM (for endmember, recommended)<br>
<ins>Start at</ins>: Indicate 1 (this correspond to the first endmember, which is the first slice)<br>
<ins>Digits (1-8)</ins>: we recommend 2. This will save each image as EM01, EM02, [...] EM20).
